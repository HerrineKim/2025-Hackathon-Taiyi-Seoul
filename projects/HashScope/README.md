# Project Name

HashScope

## Overview

This project builds an API platform on the HSK blockchain, providing real-time crypto market data for AI agents to predict market trends and execute automated trades. Users log in with their wallets, stake a certain amount of HSK tokens, and receive a Secret Key to access the API. Fees are charged based on API usage, deducted directly from staked tokens. Additionally, individuals can contribute their own data sources to the platform and earn HSK rewards when their data is utilized, creating a sustainable data economy.
